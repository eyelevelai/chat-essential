Instantly respond to customers with the World's first GPT-3 powered chat solution

== Description ==

Create a GPT-3 powered virtual assistant that can talk about your business by installing our free WordPress plugin.

When you install the plugin, we automatically ingest your WordPress website content and create a custom GPT-3-powered virtual assistant capable of talking about your business.

Deploy the virtual assistant to your website or QR codes where it will respond to your customers.

For customers that want to chat directly with you, respond to their chats from SMS text.

No apps to install or websites to monitor.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Create an account by entering an email and password
3. (Optionally) enter a US mobile phone number capable of SMS text to enable live chatting

That's it! A GPT-3 powered virtual assistant is automatically created for you.
